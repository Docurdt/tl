"*": Target set; "-": Removed; "#": Source set
* There are no enough cleavage sites remained after removing redundancy all MMP family substrates together;
* Use the M10.002, M10.003 as the target proteases which were compared in our previous work;
* Use the M10.004, M10.005, M10.008, M10.009 as the source proteases to generate the global optimal feature set;
